## Prerequisites

### Folder structure

`~/Projects` folder on your host which will be shared as `/vagrant` in the virtual machine

`~/Projects/www` folder on your host which will be shared as `/var/www` in the virtual machine and used as document root for Apache2

### Software

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)

[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) (Easiest to install via `homebrew` or something similar)

## Installation

1) Create folder and cd into it:
```
mkdir ~/Projects
cd ~/Projects
```
2) Clone the repository inside that directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/marlek/my-ansible.git Vagrant
```
3) You'll now end up with `~/Projects/Vagrant` directory. Go into each (or only desired) Ansible configurations and provision the VM. For example:
```
cd Vagrant/php73
vagrant up
```
